  "summary": "It was Adolf Anderssen (1818-79) who won the first true international tournament in London in 1851, and it was Anderssen who gave us those two wondrous creations, the Evergreen Game and the Immortal Game, contests fraught with the art of giving away pieces. Here, we’re just going to settle for an ordinary crush, exemplified by Anderssen’s victory at the London event over Marmaduke Wyvill (Black). The opening play is a little outof-date, but the finish is right up the alley of most players. The game began as a somewhat outmoded Sicilian Defensegressive moves into a sudden mating attack. The opening began as a Caro-Kann Defense.",

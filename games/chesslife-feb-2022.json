    "summary": "For seven or eight years— let’s say 1907 to 1914 — Akiba Rubinstein (1880-1961) may have been the best chess player in the world. His name often appears on lists of great players who might have become world champion if events had gone a little differently, but the quality of his performances declined significantly after the ravages of World War I. He was certainly known for his opening contributions and especially for his consummate mastery of endings. But he could also attack with power and élan, as in this month’s game against Amos Burn (Black) at Ostend in 1906. The game began as a Queen’s Gambit Declined:",

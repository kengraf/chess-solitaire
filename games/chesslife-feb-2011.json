  "summary": "It was said of Alexander Alekhine (1892-1946), the fourth world chess champion and one of the greatest players of all time, that to beat him you had beat him three times: once in the opening, once in the middlegame, and once in the endgame. But the truth is, most of the time you couldn’t beat him at all, and many of his victories were wrapped up right in the opening. Such was essentially the case with the following game played against Oscar Chajes (Black) in 1911. Alekhine hadn’t yet become Alekhine, but he sure put Chajes away quickly",
